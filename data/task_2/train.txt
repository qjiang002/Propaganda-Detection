“
bring
him
down
into

,

is
placing
himself
above

So
the
77,000
reduction
in
working-age
immigrants
from
December
2016
to
December
2017
is
consistent
with
a
gross
inflow
of
about
500,000
new
foreign-born
workers
(
legal
and
illegal
)
over
that
period—the
gross
inflow
more
than
offset
by
the
gross
reduction
of
600,000
due
to
deaths
,
deportations
,
and
immigrant
emigrants

As

since

most
Catholics
know
perfectly
well
,
despite

attempt

that
“

themselves
a

”
on
clerical
sex
abuse
with

that

The

published
an
op-ed
column
last
week
by
a

Richard

cited
neurological

conclude
that

claim
that

has
“
a
vivid
memory
of
an
attack
that
took
place
when
she
was

is
“
credible.

The
reason
,
he
wrote
,
is
that
“
memories
formed
under
the
influence
of
intense
emotion
—
such
as
the
feelings
that
accompany
a

assault
—
are

in

way
that
