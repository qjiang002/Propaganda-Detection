A

ago
,
Alex
Stein
was
a
respected
legal
academic
at
Brooklyn
Law
School
renowned
for
his
work
on
evidentiary
theory
,
as
well
as
his
notably
eclectic
intellectual
appetite
.
He
has
a
very
creative
mind.
”
Allen
says
that
because
of
the
sheer
diversity
of
topics
Stein
has
tackled
,
not
all
of
his
work
turns
out
to
be
brilliant
:
“
He
’
s
hit
some
home
runs
,
he
’
s
struck
out
too.
”
The
common
strand
is
intellectual
adventurousness
and
a
thick
skin
for
debate
.
“
In
personal
discourse
with
him
I
have
not
ever
found
him
to
have
a
hard-edge
ideological
view
,
including
not
even
a
Zionist
view.
”
Julia
Simon-Kerr
,
a
University
of
Connecticut
professor
and
a
former
law
school
student
and
mentee
of
Stein
’
s
,
has
a
similar
sense
of
his
potential
judicial
philosophy
.
“
He
’
s
not
an
ideologue
…
I
would
be
shocked
if
he
turned
out
to
be
some
kind
of
originalist
or
have
some
other
major
interpretive
lens
that
he
’
s
going
to
apply
to
every
single
case.
”
The
Supreme
Court
often
confronts
issues
at
the
core
of
Israel

s
national
existence
.
But
where
he
is
on
the
legal
status
of
the
occupied
territories
,
I
have
no
idea.
”
For
whatever
reason
,
Shaked
wanted
a
highly
qualified
Supreme
Court
candidate
who
is
also
a
relative
blank
slate
on

The
talks
between
the
Five
Star
Movement
and
the
League
,
the
parties
most
buoyed
by
Italy
’
s
election
in
March
,
marked
a
sudden
development
after
two
months
of
political
deadlock
.
Five
Star
’
s
platform
is
loaded
with
bread-and-butter
domestic
spending
policies
—
including
providing
generous
benefits
to
low-income
workers
and
the
unemployed
—
that
could
put
it
in
conflict
with
the
European
Union
.
Five
Star
officials
said
the
sticking
point
was
Silvio
Berlusconi
,
founder
of
Forza
Italia
,
who
as
a
longtime
and
scandal-prone
prime
minister
squarely
represented
Italy
’
s
political
establishment
.
The
parties
were
pushed
to
deal
with
one
another
this
week
after
President
Sergio
Mattarella
,
who
plays
a
referee-like
role
in
post-election
negotiations
,
threatened
to
establish
a
“
neutral
government
”
of
technocrats
that
could
lead
Italy
until
its
next
election
.
Although
the
March
election
didn

t
immediately
lead
to
a
new
government
,
it
registered
as
a
signal
of
anger
in
a
country
where
the
economy
remains
nearly
the
size
it
was
two
decades
ago
and
where
people
speak
routinely
about
the

At
least
two
Nigerian
soldiers
have
been
killed
and
four
injured
in
an
ambush
by
Takfiri
militants
from
the
Boko
Haram
terrorist
group
in
northeastern
Nigeria
.
An
unnamed
military
officer
said
on
Tuesday
that
the
attack
on
Monday
happened
as
soldiers
were
traveling
between
the
towns
of
Biu
and
Damboa
in
the
northeastern
state
of
Borno
.
In

on

,
Nigeria
's

announced
that
it
had
rescued
more
than
1,100
people
,
including
women
and
children
,
who
had
been
held
by
Boko

in

during

on
Monday
in

of

islands

region
.
Boko

has
used
kidnapping
as

of

,
seizing
thousands
of
women

young
girls
as
well
as

There
can
no
longer
be
any
doubt
that
we
now
have
a
propaganda
presidency
,
in
collusion
with
Republican
leaders
in
Congress
who
care
more
about
protecting
Donald
Trump
than
America
’
s
security
and
institutions
.
On
Monday
,
when
the
Republican
majority
on
the
House
Intelligence
Committee
voted
to
release
the
memo
,
there
was
also
the
early
retirement
of
deputy
FBI
director
Andrew
McCabe
–
a
target
of
Trump
and
the
latest
official
involved
in
the
Russia
probe
to
be
demoted
,
dismissed
or
to
depart
.
Adding
another
layer
of
political
intrigue
and
bitter
partisanship
,
Schiff
claimed
late
Wednesday
that
the
memo
sent
to
the
White
House
had
substantive
changes
from
the
version
the
committee
voted
to
release
.
Earlier
,
he
dismissed
the
warnings
from
law
enforcement
:
“
Having
stonewalled
Congress
’
demands
for
information
for
nearly
a
year
,
it
’
s
no
surprise
to
see
the
FBI
and
DOJ
issue
spurious
objections
to
allowing
the
American
people
to
see
information
related
to
surveillance
abuses
at
these
agencies.
”
Given
his
track
record
,
we
trust
our
top
law
enforcement
officials
far
more
than
Nunes
.
In
fact
,
there
’
s
ample
cause
to
back
the
call
Thursday
by

House
Democrat
Nancy
Pelosi
of

for
Nunes
to
be
removed

Just
two
months
later
,
Tillerson
has
racked
up
hard-fought
victories
over
administration
rivals
such
as
United
Nations
Ambassador
Nikki
Haley
and
is
pushing
ahead
with
a
heavy
travel
schedule
and
an
agenda
to
confront
North
Korea
's
nuclear
program
and
counter
drug-trafficking
,
among
other
priorities
.
But
the
top
U.S.
diplomat
appears
to
be
reaping
the
benefits
of
a
year
spent
cultivating
Trump
,
working
closely
with
Defense
Secretary
Jim
Mattis
and
learning
the
rules
of
the
Washington
power
game
that
he
professed
to
be
unfamiliar
with
after
nearly
four
decades
at
ExxonMobil
.
As
recently
as
December
,
Trump
felt
compelled
to
deny
reports
that
he
planned
to
fire
Tillerson
and
replace
him
with
CIA
Director
Mike
Pompeo
,
although
the
president
pointedly
added
that
``
we
disagree
on
certain
subjects
,
(
I
call
the
final
shots
.
)
''
Tillerson
won
a
victory
late
last
year
when
Trump
nominated
Susan
Thornton
for
assistant
secretary
of
state
for
East
Asia
and
the
Pacific
,
a
key
voice
in
the
debate
over
policy
toward
China
and
North
Korea
.
One
of
Tillerson
's
biggest
policy
victories
came
last
month
when
he
circumvented
Haley
,
with
whom
he
has
repeatedly
sparred
behind
the
scenes
,
and
won
a
reduction
of
funding
for
the
U.N.
agency
that
aids
Palestinian
refugees
rather
than
the
cutoff
she
sought

Time
for

leap
of
faith
come
Election
Day
By
Gayatri
Unsworth
Many
of
us
will
head
to
the
polls
tomorrow
,
Wednesday
,
May
9
.
Perhaps
it
’
s
reaction
fatigue
,
there
is
after
all
only
so
much
incredulity
and
outrage
one
can
muster
on
a
regular
basis
or
perhaps
it
’
s
downright
despair
,
that
no
matter
what
transpires
,
be
it
rallies
,
demonstrations
,
even
alleged
wrongdoing
coming
to
light
,
not
much
seems
to
change
.
Undoubtedly
,
I
am
not
alone
in
feeling
this
way
:
There
probably
are
innumerable
like
me
,
who
have
witnessed
first-hand
,
the
debacles
,
fiascos
and
shambles
that
have
plagued
this
nation
and
methodically
chipped-away
at
its
administrative
and
constitutional
integrity
and
worth
.
And
there
is
no
doubt
,
that
much
of
it
,
unfortunately
,
can
be
traced
back
to
the
nonagenarian
now
standing
behind
the
loudspeaker
beseeching
us
to
vote
for
him
,
imploring
Malaysians
,
from
all
walks
of
life
,
to
bestow
upon
him
the
opportunity
to
repent
and
rescue
the
nation
from
its
maladies
.
This
means
therefore
that
we
ourselves
are
also
accountable
,
at
the
end
of
the
day
,
for
those
that
we
elect
to
positions
of
authority
and
as
much
as
they
may
well
be
guilty
of
certain
transgressions
,
guiltier
still
we
would
be
for
continuing
to
tolerate
with
our
confidence
and
support
,
those
very
same
lapses
in
judgments
.

The

debated
all
over
the
West

The

.

has
been
fleeing

long
time
since
the
demise

businessmen

tax-avoidance

money-laundering
schemes
,
and
sought
refuge
for
their

these
measures
are
a
lifebelt
for
wealthy
Russians
already
facing
tough
pressure
from
Western
banking

is
clear
is

No

Hainan
a
new
mission
:
to
deepen
reform
and
further
open
up
to
the

,
by
taking
measures
to
enhance

So

Hainan
needs

improve
people
's

,

inject
fresh
vigor

WASHINGTON

The

:
give

has

ISTANBUL
(

-
The
Turkish
military
has
set
up
the
sixth
observation
post
in
northern
Syria
's
Idlib
province
on
Thursday
as
part
of
a
de-escalation
deal
which
it
agreed
with
Iran
and
Russia
,
the
army
said
.
It
said
the
observation
post
was
built
in
the
Surman
region
at
the
southeast
of
Idlib
,
the
deepest
position
Turkey

Syria

Under

with

and
Moscow
to
try
to
reduce
fighting
between
pro-government
forces
and
mainly
Islamist
insurgents
in
the
northwest
Syria
,
Turkey
agreed
to
set
up
12
observation
posts
in
Idlib
and
neighboring
provinces
.
That
deal
largely
collapsed
in
December
when

along

militias
and
heavy
Russian
air
power
launched
a

It

suit
against

County
officials
Thursday
,
two
years
after

was
acquitted
of
murder
in
the
fatal
shooting
of
Yvette
Smith
,
a
47-year-old

State
Hospital
nurse
.
Just
before
the
shooting
,
Willis
had
responded
to
a
domestic
dispute
call
and
was
standing
outside
a
home
talking
to
someone
when
he
learned
from
a
radio
dispatcher
that
a
person
inside
the
residence
had
retrieved
a
gun
and
loaded
it
,
according
to
evidence
presented
at
trial
.
A
911
call
from
inside
the
home
indicated
that
the
gun
had
been
unloaded
and
placed
on
a
table
,
but
dispatchers
didn

t
relay
that
information
to
Willis
,
according
to

Ranger
who
testified
at

trial

argues
that

deprived

Willis
of
vital
information
on
the
night

A

court
on
Friday
rejected
a
2014
jury
verdict
that
found
Jordan-based
Arab
Bank
liable
in
overseas
suicide
bombings
that
harmed
Americans
,
triggering
an
already
reached
settlement
between
the
bank
and
the
victims
in
the
closely
watched
case
.
The
terms
were
undisclosed
,
but
it
was
believed
the
decision
rejecting
the
verdict
means
that
the
bank
will
make
lower
payouts
to
American

of
tbe

of

attacks
in

in

Moreover
,
in
August
2015
,
it
recommended
the

of

security
and
political
officials
,
including
Al-Maliki
,
holding
them
responsible
for
the
escape
of
Iraqi
forces
from
Mosul
and
Daesh
control
over
it
.
The
report
of
the

included

of
military
leaders
who
confirmed
that
Al-Maliki
and
the
Governor
of
Nineveh
at

time
,
Atheel
Al-Nujaifi
,
were
responsible
for
the
fall
of

.
A
Nineveh

council
member
,
Hossam

,
stressed
that
“

”
He

to

“

,

In

,
revealed
the
existence
of

persons
“

”
who
are
involved
in
the
incident
,
noting
that
“
the
absence
of

to
hold
accountable
the
involved
parties
,
especially
that
those
in
charge
are
prominent

from

”
A

,
led
by

,
Iskander

,
considered
that
“
the

of
the
fall
of

neglected
the
names
of
political

figures.
”
He
explained
to
The

Arab
that
“
the
authors
of
the
document
neglected
for
example
the

of

,

Zebari
,
who
said
that
he

as

as

in

to
the
President
of

Kurdistan

.
It

not

it
is

,
who
failed
to
warn

of
the
danger
of
the
breakthrough
that
occurred
in

”
He
stressed
that
“
the
file
is
currently
in
the
hands

,

we
trust
it
,
but
the

from

want

answer

question
:
why
did
they
literally
risk
their
lives
to
become
Catholic
if
Islam
is
“
a
good
religion
in
itself
”
as
the
pope
“
seems
to
teach
”
?
Where
the
Gospel
proclaims
the
good
news
of
Jesus
’
death
and
resurrection
for
the
salvation
of
all
,
and
the
fulfillment
of
the
Covenant
initiated
with
the
Hebrews
,
Allah
has
nothing
to
offer
but
war
and
murder
of
the
“
infidels
”
in
exchange
for
his
paradise
:
“
They
fight
on
the
way
of
Allah
,
they
kill
and
are
killed.
”
(
Quran
9:11
)
We
do
not
confuse
Islam
with
Muslims
,
but
if
for
you
“
dialogue
”
means
the
voice
of
peace
,
for
Islam
it
’
s
only
another
way
to
make
war
.
How
can
you
speak
of
peace
and
endorse
Islam
,
as
you
seem
to
do
:
“
To
wring
from
our

(
…

Let
those
who
are
Christians
do
it
with
the
Bible
and
those
who
are

do
it
with
the
Quran
.
The
authors
say
that
Islam
can
be
no
ally
in
the
battle
“
against
the
powers
that
want
to
dominate
and
enslave
the
world
”
because
“
they
share
the
same
totalitarian
logic
based
on
the
rejection
of
the
kingship
of
Christ
(
Lk
4.7
)
.
”
They
contest
the
idea
that
speaking
in
an
“
Islamophilic
tone
”
will
help
those
Christians
who
are
suffering
persecution
in
Muslim
countries
,
professing
that
“
apart
from
the
fact
that
Jesus
has
never
indicated
any
other
way
than
that
of
the
Cross
,
so
that
we
must
find
our
joy
therein
and
not
flee
with
all
the
damned
,
we
do
not
doubt
that
only
the
proclamation
of
the
Truth
brings
with
it
not
only
salvation
,
but
freedom
as
well
(
John
8.32
)
.
”
The
letter
also
contrasts
the
stance
of
Islamic
countries
like
Turkey
and
Saudi
Arabia
who
“
do
not
welcome
any
refugee
”
while
Pope
Francis
preaches
the
welcoming
of
migrants
regardless
of
the
fact
that
they
are

,

Iranian
President
Hassan

has
warned
against
plots
to
disintegrate

in

,
Recep

,
calling
for

Rouhani
said
that
fighting

cleansing
Syria

and
countering

moves
in

are
among
the

a

Thursdays

adds
to
the

evidence

one
of

deals
in

at

—
even
mocking
its

,
as

for
having
fallen
off

“

A
decade
ago
,
in
the
midst
of
a
historic
financial
crisis
,
numerous
critics
lined
up
to
lay
the
cause
of
the
housing
meltdown
at
the
feet
of
the
African-American
,
Latinx
and
poor
communities
.
The
oft-repeated
narrative
,
advanced
particularly
by
Republicans
on
the
congressionally-created
Financial
Crisis
Inquiry
Commission
(
FCIC
)
,
contended
that
affordable
housing
policies
and
regulations
aimed
at
more
equitable
lending—as
represented
by
the
1977
Community
Reinvestment
Act
(
CRA
)
and
implemented
by
government
mortgagers
Fannie
Mae
and
Freddie
Mac
—
were
to
blame
.
However
,
this
can
not
be
independently
verified
,
given
that
,
unlike
income
,
debt-to-income
ratios
,
the
size
of
a
loan
,
and
racial
demographics
,
banks
have
successfully
blocked
efforts
to
require
them
to
report
an
applicant
’
s
credit
score
to
the
government
.
Given
these
numbers
,
Clingman
proposed
it
is
“
really
incumbent
upon
the
consumers
to
take
some
of
these
issues
into
our
own
hands.
”
Referencing
the
recent
#
BankBlack
movement
,
where
African-American
consumers
transferred
millions
to
Black-owned
banks
nationwide
as
a
“
nice
first
step
,
”
the
economist
promoted
the
need
for
a
“
reciprocal
movement
among
the
Black
banks
,
who
really
got
a
windfall
in
deposits
,
to
develop
special
kinds
of
lending
programs
for
Black
people.
”
Upon
acknowledging
these
institutions
are
subject
to
the
same
regulations
as
other
institutions
,
Clingman
suggested
“
there
are
creative
financing
initiatives
that
could
be
executed
to
ensure
reciprocity
for
those
deposits
”
before
pointing
to

BUSPH

Siegel
said
the
study
shows
that
unjustified
police

of

victims
should
be
considered
a
consequence
of
structural

.
While
some
have
suggested
that
the
high

of

killed
by

could
be
explained
by
greater

with

,
Siegel
said
that

still
found
a
strong
association
between

A

after

The

to

which
punished
the
alleged
rapists
by

do

imposing
fines
of

(
about

Officials

by
the
punishment
that
they
later
beat
up

According
to
a
decision
made
by
the
Security
Cabinet
a
year
ago
,
a
dedicated
task
force
is
supposed
to
implement
these
guidelines
and
thus
remove
the
threat
of
eviction
or
demolition
from
some
7,000
structures
in
Judea
and
Samaria
.
The
committee
noted
that
the
issue
of
these
outposts
could
also
be
solved
by
declaring
new
towns
in
Judea
and
Samaria
,
a
practice
which
Israel
had
ceased
for
two
decades
before
the
establishment
of
Havat
Gilad
this
year
.
They
rely
on
the
words
of
former
Supreme
Court
Justice
Salim
Jubran
,
who
stated
that
``
the
Israeli
residents
of
the
area
...
are
also
among
the
civilian
population
in
the
area
,
''
and
that
``
the
military
commander
is
obligated
to
act
for
their
welfare
...
also
by
violating
the
rights
Property
of
owners
of
rights
in

Another
legal
outline
referrf
to
communities
whose
extensions
have
invaded
private
land
,
usually
with
the
assistance
or
approval
of
the
government
branches
and
usually
in
good
faith
.
The
members
of
the
committee
note
that
their
solutions
to
allow
thousands
of
Jewish
structures
to
remain
in
Judea
and
SDamaria
are
in
line
with
the
Supreme
Court
rulings
and
clarify
that
they
adhere
to
three
principles
:
strict
adherence
to
the
rights
of
Arab
residents
in
accordance
with
the
rules
of

The

called
on
Monday
for
a
global
screening
system
for
the
aid
sector
to
keep
sexual
predators
out
of

and
said

The

regime
has
a
significant
stake
in

Syrian
conflict
,
as
it
wields
direct
,
robust
and
wide-ranging
influence
.
In
addition
,
Iran
’
s
deployment
of
foreign
militias
and
terrorist-designated
groups
to
fight
in
Syria
spiraled
the
initial
uprising
into
a
fully-fledged
war
and
further
radicalized
and
militarized
the
conflict
.
Currently
,
the
Iranian
regime
has
significantly
infiltrated
,
and
exercises
control
over
,
the
Syrian
political
,
intelligence
and
military
establishments.Many
experts

contend
that
,
if
it

support
,
Assad

regime
would
have
been
toppled
at

this

This

WASHINGTON
—
The
sudden
resignation
of
one
of
President
Donald
Trump
’
s
top
aides
amid
allegations
of
domestic
abuse
raised
fresh
questions
about
chief
of
staff
John
Kelly
’
s
ability
to
bring
a
tumultuous
White
House
under
control
.
The
episode
risked
tarnishing
Kelly
’
s
reputation
for
running
a
tight
ship
and
possibly
weakened
his
political
clout
in
Washington
at
a
time
when
Trump
is
looking
to
build
support
on
both
sides
of
the
aisle
over
contentious
issues
like
immigration
.
Kelly
’
s
ability
to
lead
is
also
being
questioned
within
the
West
Wing
:
several
White
House
aides
said
that
he
had
failed
Trump
if
he
had
known
about
the
allegations
against
staff
secretary
Rob
Porter
and
not
informed
the
president
.
Later
that
evening
,
he
released
a
second
statement
,
saying
that
he
“
was
shocked
by
the
new
allegations
”
and
that
“
there
is
no
place
for
domestic
violence
in
our
society.
”
People
familiar
with
the
matter
said
Kelly
was
aware
there
were
issues
in
Porter
’
s
past
impeding
his
permanent
security
clearance
more
than
a
year
into
his
tenure
.
In
a
subsequent
television
interview
,
Kelly
,
the
former
Department
of
Homeland
Security
secretary
,
said
the
president
had
“
evolved
in
the
way
he
looks
at
things
”
—
drawing
a
rebuke
from
Trump
on
Twitter
,
who
said
his
plan
had
“
never
changed
or
evolved
from
the
first
day
I
conceived
of
it.
”
Kelly
went
on
to
infuriate
immigration
advocates
and
Democratic
lawmakers
on
Feb.
6
when
he
said
some
young
immigrants
eligible
for
the
Deferred
Action
for
Childhood
Arrivals
program
had
failed
to
apply
for
the
legal
protections
because
they
were
too
afraid
—
or
“
too
lazy
to
get
off
their
asses.

It
has
been
a
busy
week
in
Washington
as
first
French
President
Emmanuel
Macron
and
then
German
Chancellor
Angela
Merkel
dropped
in
to
try
to
persuade
Mr
Trump
not
to
pull
out
of
the
2015
deal
that
prevented
Iran
from
developing
nuclear
weapons
for
the
next
decade
.
This
is
the
most
dramatic
split
in
the
Western
alliance
since
Germany
and
France
refused
to
go
along
with
the
foolish
and
illegal
invasion
of
Iraq
in
2003
(
but
Britain
went
along
with
it
to
preserve
its
imaginary
influence
in
Washington
)
.
Indeed
,
the
only
American
allies
that
have
been
urging
Mr
Trump
to
pull
the
plug
on
the
nuclear
deal
are
Israel
and
the
conservative
Arab
states
,
which
hope
to
draw
the
US
into
a
war
with
Iran
.
They
do

Israel

but
if
more
countries

had
nukes
,
the

might
one

exchange
.
It
will
probably
then
die
(
although
the
other
five
countries
will
try
to
keep
it
going
)
,
because
Iranians
'
pride
will
not
let
them
stay
in
a
deal
whose
benefits

in

of
access
to

trade

The
path
to
today
’
s
problems
with
Iran
passed
through
the
University
of
Chicago
squash
court
where
on
Dec.
2
,
1942
,
for
4½
minutes
physicist
Enrico
Fermi
,
making
calculations
on
a
slide
rule
,
achieved
the
controlled
release
of
energy
from
an
atomic
nucleus
.
Historian
Richard
Rhodes
says
that
Fermi
and
his
colleagues
were
risking
“
a
small
Chernobyl
in
the
midst
of
a
crowded
city.
”
Humanity
was
already
on
the
path
to
the
dangerous
present
in
1918
when
the
British
physicist
Ernest
Rutherford
,
who
was
criticized
for
missing
a
meeting
about
anti-submarine
warfare
,
said
,
“
I
have
been
engaged
in
experiments
which
suggest
that
the
atom
can
be
artificially
disintegrated
.
The
Soviet
Union
was
an
almost
prostrate
nation
with
a
shattered
society
when
,
just
51
months
after
the
guns
fell
silent
on
V-E
Day
(
May
8
,
1945
)
,
it
detonated
its
first
nuclear
weapon
in
August
1949
.
Obama
’
s
successor
might
learn
from
this
when
—
if
—
he
produces
an
alternative
plan
for
a
slightly
more
distant
and
less
dangerous
future
.
Nevertheless
,
in
September
2012
,
the
Senate
voted
90
to
1
for
a
nonbinding
resolution
“
ruling
out
any
policy
that
would
rely
on
containment
as
an
option
in
response
to
the
Iranian
nuclear
threat.
”
So
,
almost
six
years
ago
the
Senate
declared
unacceptable
a
policy
that
,
perhaps
six
years
from
now
,
the
United
States
might
have
no
alternative
but
to
accept

The

Thursday

a

building
the

that
would

``

that
the
United

Congress
,
on

made
to

Many

by
arguing
that

instead

at

As

of

counter
what
it
calls
“
the

,
”
the
US
has
recently
deployed
two

to
the

.
Two

Russia
was
particularly
sensitive
to
US
military

following
the

although

to
continue
their
buildup
on

in

Black

,
they
were
not
looking
at
it
as
a

The

repeatedly
censured
what
it

as

and
Russophobia
in

,
and
calls
NATO

at

a

to

Furthermore
,
Moscow
accuses

spreading

Another
day
,
another
startling
revelation
about
operatives
within
the
federal
government
who
have
specifically
worked
against
the
elected
president
,
this
one
coming
in
the
form
of

“
contacts
”
with
the

firm
that
was

by

to
dig
up
dirt
on

According
to

,
Bruce

held
two
titles
at

before

Wednesday
morning
which
included
associate

general
as

as
director

Organized

Drug

Task
Force
.
As
you
know
,
combating
transnational
criminal
organizations
and
drug
trafficking
is
a
top
priority
for
the
attorney
general.
”
Additionally
,
House
investigators
have
determined
that
Ohr
met
shortly
after
the

with
Glenn

,
the
founder
of
Fusion

the

that
hired

had
previously
covered
up

And
while
this
desire
for
reconciliation
is
not
universally
held
(
many
South
Koreans
mistrust
the
North
)
,
it
is
strong
enough
that
earlier
this
year
,
when
Kim
offered
an
olive
branch
,
Moon
was
quick
to
accept
it
.
Since
then
,
the
two
Koreas
have
seized
the
initiative
—
first
symbolically
through
the
North
’
s
participation
in
the
South
’
s
Winter
Olympics
and
later
substantively
through
a
whirlwind
of
meetings
culminating
in
an
April
summit
between
Moon
and
Kim
at
Panmunjon
,
on
the
border
between
the
two

But
it
is
worth
noting
that
he
is
also
following
his
long-stated
plan
—
first
turning
North
Korea
into
a
nuclear
state
to
ensure
its
security
and
now
focusing
on
ways
to
improve
its
economy
.
In
this
latter
aim
,
he
has
found
a
willing
ally
in
Moon
,
who
is
anxious
to
reactivate
South
Korea
’
s
so-called
sunshine
policy
toward
the
North
and
provide
Pyongyang
with
any
aid
that
does
not
run
afoul
of
UN
sanctions
.
A
few
months
ago
,
any
recalcitrance
shown
by
Kim
to
the
nuclear
issue
would
have
put
an
abrupt
end
to
talk

reconciliation
between
North
Korea
and

“

The

the

I
would
like
to
point
out
that
this

Floirendo

he

A

to
take
the

of
some

of
this
Committee
and
examine
them
in
order
to
uncover
the
lies…
…
On
January
20
,
2017
,
the
New

Times
reported
that
the
intelligence
services
were
in
possession
of
emails
,
records
of
financial
transactions
and
transcripts
of
telephone
intercepts
,
which
proved
that
Roger
Stone
,
Paul

,
and

Page
colluded
with
the
Russians
for
the
benefit
of
Donald
Trump
.
What
is
it
you
don
’
t
want
the
public
to
know
?
…
These
hearings
are
largely
based
on
a
yet
unproven
allegation
that
the
Russian
state
is
responsible
for
the
hacking
of
the
DNC
and
John
Podesta
and
the
transfer
of
that
information
to
WikiLeaks
.
…
That
the
intelligence
agencies
have
continued
to
leak
,
to
the
detriment
of
President
Trump
,
in
violation
of
the
law
,
is
proof
positive
of
their
politicization…
…
Imagine
my
deep
disappointment
when
Mr.
Schiff
purposefully
conflated
these
dates
before
this
Committee
,
reversing
them
to
create
the
false
impression
that
I
had
communicated
with
Guccifer

on

prior
to
publication
of
the

questioning
whether
Guccifer

In

constraints
on

the
progressive
development

”
as
Oxford
professor
Kalypso
Nicolaides
put
it
.
The
misguided
“
multinational
”
NATO
adventure
in
Libya
,
ostensibly
to
protect
civilians
,
instead
led
to
the
collapse
of

the
proliferation
of
jihadi
outfits
,
and
the
flooding
of
the
region
with
weapons
from
Gaddafi
’
s
arsenals
,
which
in
turn
set
the
stage
for
the
murder
of
four
Americans
in
Benghazi
.
Without
that
belief
,
diplomacy
,
negotiated
agreements
,
talks
,
and
summits
become
the
means
for
our
rivals
and
enemies
to
achieve
their
own
aims
on
the
cheap––and
for
feckless
politicians
to
create
the
illusion
of
doing
something
when
the
political
cost
of

is

high

As

an
anti-Semitic

,
the
world
’

worst
state
sponsor
of
terrorism
and
up
to
its

in
American
blood
,
was
given
in
cash

sanctions-relief

multi-billion-dollar
reprieve
from
accelerating
economic
collapse

and
a

its
aims

It
would
be

who

The

at

spot

looks
like

sea
urchin
into

creamy
strands
of
pasta
and
everyone
digs
in.There
is
a
lot
going
on
in
this
dish
,
with
sea
urchin
acting
as
just
one
of
many
components
to
deliver
an
unctuous
,
creamy
slick
of
sauce
that
is
buttery
,
umami
and
nutty
,
wrapped
around
linguine
that
is
incredibly
chewy

elastic

seven
years

explained
that
butternut
squash
puree
,
butter
and
how
the
pasta
is
cooked
all
play
a
role
in
this
toothsome
dish.According
to
Kang
,
Soresina
butter
,
sourced
from
Italy
,
is
added
to
the
pasta
and
to
the
butternut
squash
puree.The
rich
squash
puree
is
used
to
add
another
dimension
of
flavor
to
the
sauce.Then
there
is
the
linguine
itself
,
which
is
cooked
very
briefly
in
water
,
drained
and
then
left
to
slowly
soak
in
whatever
residual
moisture
is
left
in
the
noodles.The
undercooked
linguine
is
then
added
to
the
sauce
while
it
is
being
made
so
that
it
will
finish
cooking
as
the
sauce
cooks.All
of
those
carefully
thought-out
components
meld
together
into
Titolo

sea
urchin
pasta
,

that

According

received
here
from

,
Pakistan
Furniture
Council
(

Chief

as
Pakistan

,
a

of
PFC
delegation
is
recently
on
a

to

in

where
they
explored
the
opportunities
to
establish
better
liaison
between
both
the
furniture
industrialists
to

better
economic
ties
.

this

Pakistan
’

is
not
only
targeting
to
step
up

to
China

is
also
striving
to
strengthen

as

said
that
furniture
with

had
great
demand
in

markets
,
which
seems
to
be
the

A

panel
has
decided
to
invite
former
President
Benigno
Aquino

to
its

controversial

.
The

a

,

A
US
federal
appeals
court
has
ruled
that
President
Donald
Trump
's
travel
ban
targeting
people
from
six
Muslim-majority
countries
violates
the
American
Constitution
by
discriminating
on
the
basis
of
religion
,
another
legal
setback
for
the
policy
.
“
The
government
’
s
proffered
rationale
for
the
proclamation
lies
at
odds
with
the
statements
of
the
president
himself
,
”
Chief
Justice
Roger
Gregory
wrote
.
“
In
fact
,
instead
of
taking
any
actions
to
cure
the
‘
taint
’
that
we
found
infected
[
the
second
executive
order
laying
out
a
travel
ban
]
,
President
Trump
continued
to
disparage
Muslims
and
the
Islamic
faith.
”
The
ruling
,
however
,
has
mostly
a
symbolic
impact
because
of
a
case
before
the
US
Supreme
Court
.
The
ruling
means
the

can
fully

on

The

that

had
suddenly
declared
that
he
wanted
to
withdraw
all

this

be
what
motivated
Seoul
to
seek
an
agreement
with
North
Korea
,
even
at
the
risk
of
strengthening
and
emboldening
Kim

.
By
the

token
,
Europeans
also
understand
that
tariffs
can
be
imposed
at
any
moment
,
without
any
particular
regard
for
the

history
of

friendship
,
or
of
the
immense
value
—
hundreds
of
billions
of

a

—
of

It
’

no

sending

In

After

of
pain
,
the
Organization
of
the
Petroleum
Exporting
Countries
(
OPEC
)
and
its
allies
are
getting
close
to
reaping
the
full
benefits
of
their
self-restraint
on
production
.

The
International
Energy
Agency
,
the
archrival
of
OPEC
,
said
in
its
monthly
report
on
Feb.
13
that
the
oil
inventories
in
the
oil
stocks
in
the
OECD
countries
had
fallen
by
55.6
million
barrels
in
December
.
The
stocks
overhang
should
be
cleared
and
back
to
its
seasonal
normal
level
in
second
quarter
of
this
year
if
OPEC
and
its
allies
,
including
Russia
,
continue
cutting
production
by
little
less
than
1.8
million
barrels
a
day.It
should
be
a
moment
of
rejoicing
for
all
OPEC
ministers
,
but
for
Saudi
Energy
Minister
Khalid
Al-Falih
,
the
job
is
far
from
done.In
a
joint
press
conference
with
his
Russian
counterpart
Alexander
Novak
in
Riyadh
on
Feb.
14
,
Al-Falih
said
that
OPEC
and
its
allies
should
continue
with
their
agreed
production
cuts
until
the
end
of
the
year
,
even
if
the
market
rebalanced
earlier.Al-Falih
voiced
concern
over
OECD
stocks
data
and
global
oil
stocks
data
in
general
,
saying
that
these
figures
may
not
be
reliable
enough
.
So
it
is
better
to
see
a
slightly
overbalanced
market
—
another
way
of
saying
a
tight
market
—
than
exiting
the
deal
early
and
then
realizing
that
the
data
is
not
good
and
the
goal
has
not
been
achieved.Ever
since
oil
prices
increased
and
inventories
fell
down
sharply
,
there
were
talks
that
OPEC
and
Russian
oil
companies
would
consider
exiting
the
cuts
deal
in
June
when
OPEC
next
meet
.
Now
,
Al-Falih
is
saying
that
this
goal
may
not
be
achieved
and
a
new
definition
of
a
normal
level
for
global
oil
inventories
is
needed
—
and
that
is
what
OPEC
and
Russia
will
work
on
until
the
next
meeting
of
ministers
in
Jeddah
in
April.A
few
months
ago
,
I
wrote
a
column
in
this
newspaper
saying
that
the
goal
of
bringing
oil
stocks
down
to
their
normal
level
is
going
to
be
a
“
moving
average.
”
Today
,
the
situation
hasn
’
t
changed
and
the
goal
of
balancing
the
market
will
remain
a
moving
target
as
the
purposes
behind
the
agreement
keep
changing
and
the
market
dynamic
keeps
developing.OPEC
and
Russia
need
to
establish
a
long-term
deal
and
institutionalize
the

Moreover
,
absent

,
a
purported

only
be

Quite

which

,
should
be
disclosed
to

to
prevent

from
falsely
claiming

.
Although
this
utterly
transparent
practice
has
effectively
avoided
the

as
intended
,
it
has
flouted
the
Personal

throwing
the

The

that

may

tens
of
thousands
of
arrests

clampdown

have
flat-out
denied
the

reality
that
Spencer
has
so
fairly
and
meticulously
spelled
out

the
media
,
academy
,
government
,
police
,
military
,
church
,
and
other
institutions
echo
their
brazen
lies
.
For
example
,
after
the
Orlando
Pulse
massacre
,
Loretta
Lynch
's
Justice
Department
tried
to
get
away
with
omitting
Islamic
references
when
releasing
transcripts
of
perpetrator
Omar
Mateen
's
911
calls
.
When
the
American
Freedom
Defense
Initiative
,
an
organization
with
which
Spencer
is
associated
,
sought
to
snap
San
Francisco
gays
out
of
this
absurd
delusion
by
publicizing
anti-gay
pronouncements
by
Yusuf
al-Qaradawi
,
Mahmoud
Ahmedinejad
,
and
other
Muslim
heavyweights
on
the
sides
of
Bay
Area
buses
,
Spencer
was
accused
of
trying
to
“
split
gays
and
Muslims.
”
Even
supposedly
serious
students
of
world
affairs
–
people
who
recognize
that
ardent
Muslims
are
n't
exactly
fans
of
homosexuality
–
are
somehow
capable
of
magical
thinking
on
this
front
:
Spencer
quotes
a
writer
for
Foreign
Policy
,
no
less
,
who
actually
suggested
in
a
2015
article
that
if
ISIS
warriors
were
shown
enough
pictures
of
happy
same-sex
couples
,
they
'd
abjure
violence
against
gays
.
Every
time
another
person
in
the
West
wakes
up
to
the
truth
about
the
Religion
of
Peace
,
the
chances
increase
–
if
only
by
a
tiny
amount
–
that
light
may
ultimately
overcome
darkness

questions
and

testimony

matter

Mr.

last
week
secured
an
indictment
against
three
Russian
companies
and
13
Russian
citizens
for
allegedly
engaging
in
a
widespread
effort
to
interfere
in
the

inventing
fake
personas
on
social

and
staging

with
the
“

”
The
indictment
didn

accuse

skilled
prosecutors
armed

documents

In

WASHINGTON
—
President
Donald

says
it
's
``
disgraceful
''
that
a

from
special

Although

indicated

a

,

whether
the

's
actions
constitute
obstruction
of
justice
and
want
to
interview
him
about
several

,
including
his
reaction
to
Attorney
General
Jeff

,
who
has
pleaded
guilty
to
lying
to

Apparently
the
Pot
Plot
is
a
Nation
of
Islam
thing
and
its
premise
is
suspiciously
similar
to
some
:
PLO
and
Hamas
conspiracy
theories
about
Israel
.
During
a
September
appearance
at
a
mosque
in
Chicago
,
Nation

Islam
student
minister
Wesley
Muhammad
claimed
that
Jews
and
the
U.S.
government
are
engaged
in
a
“
Pot
Plot
”
to
emasculate
black
men
and
turn
them
into
homosexuals
by
distributing
specially
modified
versions
of
marijuana
.
During
his
nearly
two-hour
long
tirade
at
the
Chicago
mosque
,
Muhammad
explained
that
the
“
Pot
Plot
is
not
the
paranoid
racial
fantasizing
of
your
brother
,
but
the
Pot
Plot
is
the
actual
scheme
of
your
enemy.
”
He
continued
,
“
It
’
s
the
US
government
and
the
Synagogue
of
Satan
’
s
scheme
to
use
manipulated
marijuana
along
with
other
drugs
to
de-masculinize

feminize
the
black
male
of
America.

The

”
is
a
phrase
that

as

culprits
in

:
“
While

before

received
a
complaint
from

on

then
there
have

of
him

so
we

NATIONAL
(

WASHINGTON/SEOUL
--
US
President
Donald
Trump
has
ordered
the
Pentagon
to
review
downsizing
American
troops
stationed
in
South
Korea
,
a
US
news
report
said
Friday.The
president
told
the
Department
of
Defense
to
``
prepare
options
for
drawing
down
American
troops
in
South
Korea
''
in
the
run-up
to
his
landmark
summit
with
North
Korean
leader
Kim
Jong-un
in
the
following
weeks
,
The
New
York
Times
reported
.
The
news
outlet
cited
several
people
briefed
on
the
order.The
downsizing
is
not
designed
as
a
``
bargaining
chip
''
in
Trump
's
talks
with
Kim
,
but
a
peace
treaty
between
the
two
Koreas
could
diminish
the
need
for
the
presence
of
the
more
than
20,000
American
soldiers
on
the
South
side
of
the
Korean
Peninsula
,
the
report
said.The
Times
also
attributed
the
downsizing
order
to
the
ongoing
negotiations
between
Washington
and
Seoul
over
how
to
share
the
cost
of
keeping
the
US
forces
on
the
peninsula.Trump
has
been
determined
to
withdraw
the
troops
,
arguing
that
the
United
States
is
not
adequately
compensated
for
the
cost
,
according
to
the
report.The
Pentagon
declined
to
confirm
the
report
,
saying
only
that
the
US
remains
committed
to
its
mission
.
``
The
Department
of
Defense
's
mission
in
South
Korea
remains
the
same
,
and
our
force
posture
has
not
changed

``
He
added
that
``
we
all

.
``
The
high
possibility
of
negotiating
an
inter-Korean
peace
treaty
between
Trump
and
Kim
at
the
upcoming

brought
into
question
the

role

North
Korean
aggression.President
Moon

fueled
the
question
further
after

an
article

Affairs
magazine
saying
it
will
be
``
difficult
to
justify
''
the
presence
of
USFK
after
signing
a
peace
treaty.This
immediately
aroused
the
ire
of
South
Korean
conservatives
,
who
argue
the
withdrawal
would
mean
a
weakening
of
the
South
Korea-US
treaty
alliance
and
the
removal
of
the
US
nuclear
umbrella
over
South
Korea.As
the
controversy
spreads
,
the
presidential

Cheong

still

Air
India
’
s
desire
to
fly
through
Saudi
Arabia
to

West
and
stop
in

has
been
covered
widely
in
the
current
“

”
media
,
accusing
Saudi
Arabia
of
allowing
the
Indians
to
pass
through
to
the
old
“

,
”
Israel
.
The
body
concerned
,
the
Saudi
General
Authority

(
GACA
)
,
has
denied
the
claim
and
said
that
it
had
not
given
its
consent.However
,
let
us
consider
the
issue
realistically
,
from
the
logic
of
interests
and
international
relations
.
It
is
hostile
to
exercise
sovereign
rights
,
including
preventing
a
country
from
using
airspace
due
to
potential
security
problems
stemming
from
allowing
its
aircraft
to
fly
over
the
territory
of
the
state.Our
relations
with
the
countries
of
the
rest
of

world
are
good
,
and
we
are
supposed
to
allow
their
civilian
aircraft
to
pass
through
Saudi
airspace
,
regardless
of
their
destination.So
if
the
Indian
flights
were
going
to
Athens
or
New
York
or
other
destinations
and
wanted
to
stop
at
an
Israeli
airport
,
why
punish
them
with
a
ban
?
It
has
to
be
noted
that
Israel
benefits
from
transporting
passengers
under
the
ban
and
the
absence
of
other
international
airlines
that
do
not
want
to
cross
the
additional
distance
,
estimated
at
about
two
hours
,
if
traveling
on
a
tortuous
route
between
India
and
Israel.In
all
cases
,
our
dispute
with
Israel
is
very
clear
.
They
banned
us
from
importing
most
electronics
,
such
as
Apple
products
,
and
in
the
past
they
prevented
any
dealing
with
major
companies
such
as
Xerox.The
lists
of
boycotted
products
were
prepared
by
the
Damascus
provincial
office
,
which
controlled
the
trade
of
the
Gulf
states
,
and
these
states
had
to
follow
the
rules
laid
out
by
countries
that
did
not
import
such
products
either
because
of
their
hostility
to
the
West
or
the
West
’
s
prohibition
on
dealing
with
them
in
the
first
place
,
such
as
Syria.Corruption
was
rampant
in
those
procedures
,
leaving
negotiations
in
the
past
for
governments
and
institutions
that
often
abused
their
powers
to
serve
the
whims
of
their
governments
or
even
personal
financial
interests
.

Trading
in

shares
in
Hong

has
been
halted
since
the

slapped

with

last
month
Chinese
telecom
giant
ZTE
has
asked
the
US
government
to
lift
a
ban
on
sales
to
the
company
,
which
threatens
its
survival
and
has
added
to
trade
tensions
between
Washington
and
Beijing
.
The
telecom
equipment
and
handset
maker
said
in
a
filing
Sunday
that
it
had
submitted
a
request
to
the
commerce
department
for
a
stay
of
the
export
ban
,
along
with
supplemental
information
.
US
officials
imposed
the
ban
because
of
what
they
said
were
false
statements
by
the
firm
over
action
it
claimed
to
have
taken
regarding
the
illegal
sale
of
goods
to
Iran
and
North
Korea
.
The
ban
prohibits
US
companies
from
selling
crucial
hardware
and
software
components
to
ZTE
for
seven
years
,
with

Chinese
investment
bank
estimating
it

has
described
the

nuclear
accord
with

as
the

,
saying

he
was
giving
them
“
a

”
to
join
the

“

in

”
The
remarks

refrain
from
any

If
those
in
government
were
performing
their
God-given
duty
as
a
minister
of
God
against
evildoers
(
Romans
13:1-5
)
,
then
we
would
have
no
need
of
a
background
check
,
forms
or
any
of
these
ridiculous
,
unconstitutional
agencies
like
the
ATF
because
violent
criminals
would
be
put
down

permanently

via
the
death
penalty

label propaganda
Both
Strzok
and
Rosenstein
have
literally
destroyed
their
credibility
by
stonewalling
Congress
over
the
investigations
into
Hillary
Clinton
’
s
email
server
,
which
,
conveniently
Mueller
now
has
enough
information
to
take
to
the
Grand
Jury
.
Both
Strzok
and
Rosenstein
know
that
Attorney
General
Jeff
Sessions
is
completely
compromised
and
can
do
nothing
to
stop
them
from
obstructing
investigations
and
turning
our
justice
system
into
something
worse
than
farce
.
On
the
other
hand
,
it
does
a
bang-up
job
of
shifting
the
news
cycle
away
from
Trump
’
s
heavy-handed
but
effective
steam-rolling
Germany
and
the
UK
over
NATO
spending
,
energy
policy
and
Brexit
.
Trump
continues
,
in
his
circuitous
way
,
to
stick
a
fork
in
the
eye
of
the
globalists
whose
water
politicians
like
Angela
Merkel
and
Theresa
May
have
carried
for
years
.
Now
with
Trump
prepared
to
sit
down
with
Putin
and
potentially
hammer
out
a
major
agreement
on
many
outstanding
issues
like
Syria
,
arms
control
,
NATO
’
s
purpose
,
energy
policy
and
terrorism
the
Deep
State/Globalist/Davos
Crowd
needed
something
to
saddle
him
with
to
prevent
this
from
happening
